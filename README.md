# Bayesian Network Mediation Model (BNMM)

## Description

BNMM is an integrative mediation model with networks entailing the mediation effect from the exposure to the outcome. We develop the Bayesian algorithm and R scripts to implement the posterior inference. The details of the model and implementation are described in our paper *Bayesian Network Mediation Analysis with Application to Brain Functional Connectome*.  

## Usage

Please download the R script, change the path to where you want to store the result, then run the code by order. The first part of R script is the data generation for one of our simulation settings, the second part is the model implementation.
