# Bayesian Network Mediation Model (BNMM)

## Description

BNMM is an integrative mediation model with networks entailing the mediation effect from the exposure to the outcome. We develop the algorithm and R scripts to implement the model. The details of algorithm are described in our paper *Bayesian Network Mediation Analysis with Application to Brain Functional Connectome*, submitted to *Journal*. Here we include the simulation of scenario 2 that we used in our paper to help readers understand the algorithm, reproduce the result of the simulation study, and conduct analysis with their own data.


## Usage

Please download the R script, change the path to where you want to store the result, then run the code by order. The first part of R script is data generation (scenario 2), the second part is model fitting.
